# Development Notes

My personal development notes, written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Most of the juicy stuff is in the `Cheat sheets/` folder, especially the React and Vue 3 notes.

These notes aren't meant to be comprehensive! I wrote them for myself, so they don't include things I already know well.
