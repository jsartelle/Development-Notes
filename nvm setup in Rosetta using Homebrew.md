1. Add this to VSCode settings:

``` json
"x86 zsh üíª": {
    "path": "/usr/bin/arch",
    "args": ["-arch", "x86_64", "/bin/zsh"]
}
```

2. Use the x86 zsh to install Homebrew
3. Use `/usr/local/bin/brew` to install nvm
4. Set up *brew-x86* alias and nvm in `~/.zshrc`:

```shell
alias brew-x86="/usr/local/bin/brew"

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "/usr/local/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && \. "/usr/local/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"                                       # This loads nvm
[ -s "/usr/local/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm" ] && \. "/usr/local/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm" # This loads nvm bash_completion

```

5. Reinstall *node_modules* in projects using the x86 terminal (using the ARM install of Yarn seems to be okay)

## Fish setup

1. Use `brew-x86` in ZSH to install fish
2. Add this to VSCode settings:

``` json
"x86 fish üêü": {
    "path": "/usr/bin/arch",
    "args": ["-arch", "x86_64", "/usr/local/bin/fish"]
}
```

3. Run this in x86 fish to add the *brew-x86* alias:

```shell
alias -s brew-x86="/usr/local/bin/brew"
```

4. Follow steps in [[nvm on mac for fish users]] (but use `brew-x86`)
